# Redfish Schemas - User Documentation

This document contains details about specific properties contained within Schemas defined by the Redfish Specification.  Proper use of section headers allows for the Generator to incorporate the additional information automatically.


# Introduction

====== Schema Definition ======

# Postscript

# Excluded Properties

This section documents properties that are either common throughout the Redfish Schema, or are defined in the Resource.1.x.x or odata.4.x.x schema files.  Therefore, for clarity, they are excluded from the schema-specific tables.

## @odata.context

## @odata.id

## @odata.type

## *@odata.count

## *@odata.navigationLink

# Excluded Schemas

Schemas listed here are excluded from the output document.  This can be used to remove supporting documents while still allowing for easy bulk processing of whole schema directories.

# Schema Supplement

This is the schema-specific section.  2nd-level headings indicate the schema name with the major version appended (default is "_1" if not present).
